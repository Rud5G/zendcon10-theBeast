About the workshop
------------------

Call it what you will: Brownfield Project, Big Ball of Mud or just legacy code. As developers we rarely find ourselves in a Greenfield Project without any constraints that are imposed by prior work of less than optimal quality. In this workshop you will learn see that architecture and testability are related and how to turn bad code into good, testable code. No question goes unanswered when we pull up an editor and explain best practices while we refactor and unit test an MVC application live.
